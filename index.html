      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>1894</strong> - Albert finished his schooling in Munich with medical training. He moved to Milan with his family.

      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>1902</strong> - Albert Einstein got a job in the patent office. He used his understanding of math and science in his new position, and it made him happy.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>1905</strong> - Einstein submitted his first paper on his theory of thermodynamics. It was the first of many.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>1909</strong> - After working at the patent office and writing his theories, Einstein got a job teaching theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>1911</strong> - He was given an invitation to the first-ever world physics conference. He was the youngest physicist there.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>1913</strong> - He believed science's understanding of gravity was wrong, and he worked on a new theory which he would later test with a solar eclipse.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>1919</strong> - After publishing his Theory of Relativity and correctly predicting the effects of a solar eclipse, Einstein's name went around the world.

      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>1945</strong> - World War II ended and Einstein continued his research. He made advances in heat, gravity, and relativity, and he published over 300 scientific reports.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1955</strong> - Albert Einstein died in April of heart failure.
